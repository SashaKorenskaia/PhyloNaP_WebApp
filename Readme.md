# PhyloNaP - Phylogenetic Natural Product Database

## Overview

PhyloNaP is the first large-scale resource dedicated to phylogenies of biosynthetic enzymes. The platform provides ~18,500 annotated and interactive phylogenetic trees enriched with chemical, functional, and taxonomic information. Users can classify their own sequences via phylogenetic placement, enabling functional inference in an evolutionary context.

## Abstract

Phylogenetic analysis is widely used to predict enzyme function, yet building annotated and reusable trees is labor-intensive. Existing resources rarely cover secondary metabolites' synthesising enzymes and lack the biosynthetic context needed for meaningful analysis.

We present PhyloNaP, the first large-scale resource dedicated to phylogenies of biosynthetic enzymes. PhyloNaP provides ~18,500 annotated and interactive trees enriched with chemical, functional, and taxonomic information. Users can classify their own sequences via phylogenetic placement, enabling functional inference in an evolutionary context. A contribution portal allows the community to submit curated trees. By combining scale, breadth of annotation, and interactive functionality, PhyloNaP fills a major gap in bioinformatics resources for enzyme discovery and annotation, with immediate applications to secondary metabolism and beyond.
